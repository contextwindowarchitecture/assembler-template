"""Name a new port made from the template: fill the language, package and commands into its files.

Run it once, from the port's root, right after creating the repository from the template (PORTING.md, step 1). It:

  - fills <Language> and the command placeholders into AGENTS.md and the commented test job in .github/workflows/ci.yml;
  - names the package and language in NOTICE;
  - replaces the template's README.md with the port's starter README (the outline at the end of PORTING.md);
  - fills the language and package into PORTING.md, so its commands can be pasted as they are;
  - adds the GitHub remote as origin when --repository is given and the checkout has no origin yet.

A command left out stays a placeholder to fill by hand. It refuses to run twice. Standard library only.

README = """# {package}

A {language} assembler for the [Context Window Architecture](https://contextwindowarchitecture.io) (CWA) draft specification. It admits candidate items, resolves declared conflicts, fits them to a token budget, renders the payload and emits the trace.

Status: in development. It passes none of the published conformance cases yet; `conformance-report.json` records the current run.

## Install

TODO: how to add the package to a project.

## Use

TODO: the call and its types, in the language's terms. What it must say:

- `assemble(snapshot)` takes a snapshot in the shape of `schema/snapshot.schema.json`, the frozen assembly input (R-23), and returns the payload, the rendered UTF-8 bytes, or null when the assembly is refused (`trace.refused.reason` says why), together with a trace valid against `schema/trace.schema.json`.
- A snapshot that fails its schemas or the snapshot checks is rejected with its problems in words: no payload and no trace (R-17).
- A snapshot that names a tokenizer or renderer this package does not provide is unsupported, not invalid. The package provides the tokenizers `fixture-whitespace/v1` and `estimate-utf8/v1` and the renderers `fixture-xml/v1` and `cwa-messages/v1`; callers pass their model's tokenizer, and a renderer if the package takes any, under an id no published component of that kind uses; a published id, even one this package does not provide, stops the call before assembly with no payload and no trace (R-16).
- `trace_id` and `timings` may differ between runs of the same snapshot (R-23); everything else, the payload bytes included, is deterministic.

## Requirements

TODO: the runtime versions this package supports.

## Development

```sh
{install}
{build}
{test}
```

## Cost

Every reduction under budget pressure is its own fit test, and every fit test renders and counts the whole payload (conformance/README.md, Fitting). Keep the cost down at the source, as the spec advises: send no more passages than the route's budget can use, and bound slots with `max_per_source` or `max_tokens`.

## Conformance

```sh
{conformance}
```

This runs every vendored case and rejection snapshot as `conformance/README.md` describes. It writes `conformance-report.json`, valid against `schema/conformance_report.schema.json`, and exits 1 unless every case passed and every rejection snapshot was rejected, apart from those skipped for an optional component. A case passes only when its payload matches byte for byte and its trace matches field for field, except `trace_id` and `timings`. The committed report is the current run: a test fails when it goes stale. A case is skipped only when it uses a tokenizer or renderer the vendored README lists under Optional, such as `cwa-message-blocks/v1`, and this package does not provide it; a case that uses only required ones and does not pass has failed.

The Assembler page lists this implementation once its report is in the specification repository's `implementations/`: run `python3 conformance/import_report.py ../assembler-{slug} {slug} --label {language}` in a checkout of that repository and open a pull request with the files it writes (its `conformance/README.md`, Reporting results).

## The contract

`vendor/cwa/` holds the published contract this implementation follows: the schemas, the contract data and the conformance cases, copied from the specification repository, [contextwindowarchitecture/contextwindowarchitecture](https://github.com/contextwindowarchitecture/contextwindowarchitecture), with `python3 scripts/vendor_contract.py --spec ../contextwindowarchitecture`. `vendor/cwa.lock.json` pins each file by SHA-256 and records the repository and the commit it came from (`spec_commit`); the report's `contract` names both. It is Apache-2.0 licensed; see `vendor/cwa/LICENSE` and `vendor/cwa/NOTICE`.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the working rules.
