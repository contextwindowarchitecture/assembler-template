"""Check a conformance report against the vendored contract, whichever runner wrote it.

    python3 scripts/check_report.py                     # conformance-report.json: exit 1 on any problem or any failure
    python3 scripts/check_report.py --allow-failures    # exit 1 on structural problems only, while cases are pending

Checks that the report validates against conformance_report.schema.json (when the jsonschema package is
installed); that its contract names the repository, commit and dirty flag the lock records, as {"repository",
"commit", "dirty"} (the repository defaults to contextwindowarchitecture/website), so a report still in the old
{"website_commit", "dirty"} shape fails; that cases and rejections list
every directory under the vendored conformance cases and rejections, in id order, with the rules from each
case.json; that every skipped row's detail names, as "<kind> <id> is not provided", an optional component its case
uses, since a port that lacks only required ones has failed the case; and, unless --allow-failures, that every case passed and
every rejection snapshot was rejected, apart from those skipped for an optional component the port leaves out
(conformance/README.md, Reporting results). CI runs it so a partial or stale report never lands.
